The basic motivation behind this project is to run a webrtc based simple application on latest WebRtc Stack. I have compiled fresh WebRtc Library for `Linux OS`.
I have made it very simple for *webrtc newbies* and for *webrtc geeks* to understand and build large projects using the development setup.

This tutorial assumes that you are on a UNIX-based system, I am on Ubuntu and have tested versions *18.04 LTS* and *20.04 LTS*.

> Note: I recommend WebRtc Linux development on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS


**Basic Usage:**

You can run this program in different IDEs and build tools such as;

- Visual Studio 2019-2022
- Clion Latest version
- Using Cmake Build Tools
